# 2.3: What are the essential components of an abstract?

What are the essential components of an abstract?

Having read Chapter 3 of the module text and watched the ‘What is research?’ presentation, return to page 29 and consider, ‘What components do I expect to see in an abstract?’

In this discussion forum you will first share your thoughts, then reply to two classmates.

Add a thread to this discussion forum and share the following:

(a) What are your thoughts on what makes a good abstract? What would best tell you whether or not to read the whole paper? Might this vary from subject to subject or situation to situation?  Or are there some ‘universal’ rules?

I think what constitutes a good abstract is one that:
- Explains the background of the topic at hand or introduce it.
- Explains the key purpose/purposes of the research.
- Explains how the data comes together and the key findings of the research.
- Gives insight to the claims made and conclusion of the research.

You should walk away from reading an abstract feeling confident the paper or research at hand can contribute for the purposes you require. It should be linked to the topic you are researching and answer some inital probing questions you have previously determined for requiring this information. 

For exapmle, for the question, _"Should I be scared of AI?"_

Consider the abstract below: 
Fear is growing that robots and artificial intelligence will replace many occupations. To remain relevant in this changing career landscape, the worker of the future is expected to be innovative, able to spot opportunities transform industries and provide creative solutions to meet global challenges. To develop such capabilities, work integrated learning (WIL) has emerged as an important approach. The purpose of this study is to investigate the key factors driving innovation among WIL students. Unlike prior studies that have been predominantly qualitative or based on one single snapshot, this quantitative, longitudinal study measures student capabilities before and after participation in a WIL placement at a business. It then undertakes confirmatory factor analysis to compare pre- and post-placement capabilities. The study found that critical thinking, problem solving, communication and teamwork have significant impacts on the development of innovation: vital in the era of artificial intelligence (Rampersad, 2020).
