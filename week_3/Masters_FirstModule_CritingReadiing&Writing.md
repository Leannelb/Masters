1.7.1: How might EC#45 be interpreted in terms of different approaches to research?

Discussion -How might EC#45 be interpreted in terms of different approaches to research?
Question: Having read EC#45, think about how the different approaches to playing the D&D game might reflect different types of research.

In this discussion forum you will first share your thoughts, then reply to two classmates.

Add a thread to this discussion forum and share the following:

(a) Talk about those characters you recognise (or successfully looked up) and explain why you think the approach the game the way they do. Does this perhaps suggest a particular research style?

Return to the discussion forum and read the answers of your classmates.  Select two class mates, reply to their posts and for each one:

(b) Comment on how similar or dissimilar your conclusions are, particularly if your classmates’ comments have reminded you of anything you didn’t include in your own comment. Note any of the characters you didn’t know before.

I get the imression Samuel Beckett, the Irish novilist and playwright takes things in his stride, he's not interested in avid research it would seem. Kurt Godel appears to be an organised and thoughtout planner. Whereas George Cantor seems less concered with a plan. His style is to jump in and go for it, being a mathmetician he seems to add a valuable argument as does Kurt Godel.

Fyodor Dostoyevsky is passionate and direct in his commnication and research style possible mirrors this. Shakespeare is a romantic and wordsman, really getting into his role having seeming to thouroguhly researched it.
