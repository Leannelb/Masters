## 1.8: Conscious chapters 1–5
icon Reading- Conscious, chapters 1-5

Now we’re going to make a start on the background reading. This phase introduces the central characters and begins to identify the ‘problem’ they’re going to be trying to solve as the story unfolds. Remember, this is only a novel: it can be read quickly – and hopefully enjoyed. However, do have a particular think about the artificial intelligence discussions in the novel. These are relevant to the second summative assessment.

As you read this, please consider these questions:

Are there any characters you feel you identify with, coming from your own educational background? (Academic tradition?)
Which of the characters seems to ‘think’ like you – or very unlike you?
What different strengths (and maybe weaknesses) do think each of the characters might bring to the group? (Don’t try to get too precise with this at this stage because we’re yet to discover exactly what the ‘problem’ is.)
Does the written paper in Chapter 5 give you any further thoughts on next week’s ‘Should I be afraid of AI?’ question?
