3.3: Critical summaries

Wallace & Wray, chapter 6

Read Chapter 6, ‘Creating a Comparative Critical Summary’ (pages 61-71) of the module text. This chapter looks deeper into the structure of a ‘critical review’ and illustrates this with some examples. Read carefully because you’re going to be doing one of these in the next activity! It introduces a number of good questions to be asking in building your ‘critical synopsis’. It discusses how to introduce the material and report the content (good practice for the formative assessment to follow) and how to evaluate it leading to a conclusion. (Reminder: being ‘critical’ is being ‘fair’: not the same as being ‘cynical’!)

As you read this, please consider these questions:

Why would you want to write a ‘critical review’?
What’s the purpose of a critical review?
What are the essential parts of a critical review?
What might be good or bad ‘signs’ to watch for when reading material?
What’s the difference between deciding whether material is ‘relevant’ and deciding if it’s ‘any good’?
