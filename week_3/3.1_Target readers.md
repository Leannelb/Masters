3.1: Target readers


Read Chapter 5, ‘Getting Started on Self-Critical Writing’ (pages 51–60) of the module text.

This chapter begins to analyse the concept of an ‘argument’ (from both your and others’ point of view), considering the audience for which the material is intended. It then moves on to introducing the concept and outline of a ‘critical review’ for different types of material: a research article, book chapter, etc. As always, there’s a focus on if and how the arguments presented support the ‘claim’ or ‘conclusion’.

As you read this, please consider these questions:

Does ‘argument’ have a more precise meaning in academia that its wider use in everyday English?
Are there different types of argument depending on the setting or context?
Does that mean they have to be presented differently?
Are there common features/principles that any (good) argument should contain or follow?
Are there different ways to critically assess an argument?
Are some of these better than others in different contexts?
