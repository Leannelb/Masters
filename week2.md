# 2.0: Week 2

- Note that there are two research-based modules on this programme.  The second, gets your own ‘primary’ research – ready for your dissertation.  
- Focus of this module: finding and analysing existing ‘secondary’ research – that probably means it’s been done by others.  
##### Try to remember that please; it will help keep this fairly simple.

- During this week, we’ll continue the theme of how to find information and look in some detail at the ‘critical reading’ process and apply it particularly to paper abstracts.  
- We’ll consider what makes an argument convincing or how – in contrast – a conclusion or ‘claim’ might be unconvincing through bias or poor data, analysis or reasoning.  
- Also continue with the module text and the background reading.  Both, in their own ways, will introduce you to various types of argument and different ways of approaching them.  
The larger assessments begin next week so we’re taking advantage of the time this week to have lots of different discussions with classmates about abstracts and arguments, etc.  We’ll finish the week with a practical debate on the possible dangers of artificial intelligence (AI), using the skills we’ve practiced and based on a discussion in the background reading.

This week I am asking you to take part in a series of discussions. The goal of these discussions is to help you to identify writing rationales – that is to recognise the reasons people right, and how arguments can influence the reader.

As you work through this week’s content, consider the following:

1. Am I getting better at finding relevant information?
2. How are abstracts useful to me when I look for information?
3. What’s the most useful part of an abstract to me?
4. What makes an argument ‘good’ or ‘bad’? (Is it always that simple?)
5. How will I present information, arguments and conclusions clearly and logically?
6. (Final exercise) What do I understand ‘artificial intelligence’ to mean?
