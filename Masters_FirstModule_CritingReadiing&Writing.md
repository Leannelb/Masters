Discussion -How might EC#45 be interpreted in terms of different approaches to research?
Question: Having read EC#45, think about how the different approaches to playing the D&D game might reflect different types of research.

In this discussion forum you will first share your thoughts, then reply to two classmates.

Add a thread to this discussion forum and share the following:

(a) Talk about those characters you recognise (or successfully looked up) and explain why you think the approach the game the way they do. Does this perhaps suggest a particular research style?

Return to the discussion forum and read the answers of your classmates.  Select two class mates, reply to their posts and for each one:

(b) Comment on how similar or dissimilar your conclusions are, particularly if your classmates’ comments have reminded you of anything you didn’t include in your own comment. Note any of the characters you didn’t know before.
