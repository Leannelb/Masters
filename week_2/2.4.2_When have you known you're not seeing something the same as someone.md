icon Discussion - When have you known you're not seeing something the same as someone?
Question:
Now, you’re definitely going to have to think of an example for this exercise. Think of a situation in the past (in any context at all), where you’ve been discussing or arguing a point with someone before you (perhaps both) realised you were looking at it from completely different viewpoints – perhaps at a more basic level. How did it happen? How was it eventually resolved?

In this discussion forum you will first share your thoughts, then reply to two classmates.

Add a thread to this discussion forum and share the following:

(a) Describe your misunderstanding. What assumptions led to the confusion in the first place? What confusion did it cause? How did you realise? How was it put right? What happened then? Return to the discussion forum and read the answers of your classmates.

Select two class mates, reply to their posts and for each one:

(b) Comment on any similarities from your own experience. Could the same thing have happened to you? Was anyone in particular to blame? Would you have resolved the misunderstanding differently?  

Expectations:
Please post your initial answer by Friday, 23:59 of this week. This will allow your classmates to read everyone responses and respond to two other students by Sunday, 23:59 of this week.

I remember a time from my more primitive years, I had a very interesting conversation with my grandmother. When I got my first paying job as a chambermaid in a hotel in town, I remember coming home so excited, I had done it! I was a member of the workforce! I could pay my way and I was going to be rich, I could finally afford all the finer things in life and everything I ever needed or wanted, I could obtain, or so I thought.My parents were so supportive in this endeavour, understanding the importance of me getting out there and getting a job to learn the skills it required to get on in life and learn the reality of it all too. My parents were delighted, Leanne's out there, making her way and making some extra cash at the weekends, although their primary concern was always that I did well in school and studied hard, this came at a far greater importance of any part-time job. So much so, that eventually one year, an exam week in UNI coincided with a very busy week in work (I had since moved on from that first job and was then a waitress). I came home upset and started crying to my dad, I was so overloaded in work and really all I wanted to do was study, I had exams around the corner and I'd been booked in for double shifts for the next few weekends. After allowing me to cry for a minute and looking at the crocodile tears rolling down my face (giving me the minute of dramatics and feeling sorry for myself), my father looked me straight in the eye and told me to call up, right this second and quit. He told me I should have known, my studies are the most important and I should never feel this extra pressure from secondhand things. The only thing I should be worried about was my studies. My father is my best friend and his support, encouragement and guidance are the most valued things to me in my life, I am forever grateful to have this wonderful man happen to be my dad too.I got slightly off topic but some context was perhaps needed. I remember it as clear as day, I walked in an exclaimed so excited to my grandmother (my fathers mother) that I had a new job, soon I was going to get a paycheck and even sooner, I'd be rolling in it.. My grandmother looked at me and said, "okay well a third to you, a third to savings and a third to the house." "What!" I exclaimed, a third to me a third to the house and a third to save, what do you mean?" Well, you need to put away a third, give a third to your father and a third goes into a savings account." My assumption was, I don't need to give any money to the house, I don't need to save either! I just want to keep all my hard earned money myself! My grandmother understood the ways of the world far better than I did and was trying to steer and teach me in the right way. Although I refused to believe she was making any sense and was too stubborn to hear her out. As a result of my complete lack of acceptance of anything she said, I stared from her to my father with my eyes saying "this can't be for real, I get to keep all my money right?" and with my grandmother looking at my father with a look that said, "how on earth is your daughter fighting me on this one Tony, what have you taught her at all!"It concluded with my grandmother and I both being extremely stubborn on the topic and neither giving way on their convictions
