Have you read abstracts before?

Having read Chapter 3 of the module text, return to page 29 and consider, ‘Where or how have I used abstracts in the past?’

In this discussion forum you will first share your thoughts, then reply to two classmates.

Add a thread to this discussion forum and share the following:

(a) (Most of you will have previously studied a technical undergraduate degree, or similar qualification.) How have you made use of abstracts in the past?  Have they been useful?  What has been the most important element of an abstract?  How do you think any of this might be different for this new postgraduate Masters degree?

Return to the discussion forum and read the answers of your classmates.  Select two class mates, reply to their posts and for each one:

(b) Comment on how similar or dissimilar your experience has been, particularly if your classmates’ thoughts have reminded you of anything you didn’t include in your own comment.

Abstracts are a hugely helpful part of researching any topic. Their significance cannot be understated. In the past, I have used abstracts extensively to get an understanding of the paper in question, what it is the author is trying to convey in the paper as a whole, what the outcomes may have been and how all of this can assist me in getting the information I need from the paper to support my stance.  

The entire abstract I find hugely helpful, scanning the abstract of a paper during the initial stages of information gathering assists me to decipher the papers that will be of most value to me going ahead. If looking for a certain topic, for example, I would start by doing a keyword search, with filters for a year, or whatever other aspects may be helpful for the particular research topic. Then I would read the titles, looking for interesting papers and articles that will help me gather information for the topic at hand. Following the finding of seemingly relevant papers, the next step is to read the abstract, which usually severely narrows the interest.
 By reading an abstract I can generally tell if the paper will, or will not be useful to me. In addition to this, it is rare, if after reading an abstract and determining it is useful, that then upon reading the full paper I do not find some relevant information to the topic I initially was gathering the information for. Even if the paper is not exactly what I was looking for, I would usually find other papers referenced that would be more in line with the supporting, or contradictory information I was initially searching for.

Once I have shortlisted perhaps 10 papers, I would then delve into each one in a more focused manner, having a set of questions set out I wish to be answered, but also reading in more depth to understand the work that was done and the information the author wishes to convey. Without the initial search and reading of abstracts to create this shortlist, the time spent researching and therefore not understanding in-depth and writing, would be greatly reduced so they are an invaluable tool in the researchers' arsenal. I think in the upcoming learning, abstracts will continue to be as useful and helpful to me as ever!
