# 2.2: What is research?
icon Lesson - What is research? 

As you watch the lecture, please reflect on the following:

What do you think the essential features of a Masters student are?
How do these features apply to research?
Where will your emerging critical and analytical skills come in?
How will this lead to you being able to ‘evaluate’ and make ‘judgements’?
Where does being ‘reflective’ and ‘self-critical’ fit in to all this?
What are the obstacles to good research? Where can it go wrong?

(a) Summarise where you’ve used research skills previously. Explain what might be needed now for Masters study.  What’s going to be different?  What are you going to have to particularly work on do you think?  Do you need any advice on any of it?

#### Answer

In my previous education, I've been fortunate to have already obtained a double B.Sc. in Bilogy and Computer Science and an M.Sc. in Immunology and Global Health. As a result of this education I also worked in the Pharmecutical Sector, both in Research and Development at Phizer and as a Quality Control Analyist in many other roles. My past education and proffessional experience has therefore been littered with the ability to carry out research in an objective way. I'm not sure what to expect from this Masters and the dissertation that is to come but I'm sure thorough research, gathering and disectintg of information will be required and for that I am grateful for my past experience. I think although I have this initial experience, there is certainly  always room for improvement and the way we have started this masters, I feel, is really delving into the specific skills needed and looking at them individually, so by the time we need to put them all together, we will be more versed, better able and more guided in our approach.

I already feel from the material covered that I am much more aware of the true purpose of academic research and also to be more awake, critical and meticulous in my approach going forward.

I'm sure as I get through the course there will be areas I may need advice on. Once thing does come to mind now, it was said we will have to engadge in 'primary research' later on in the course. "gets you ready to take on your dissertation; so its focus is very much on you doing your own research – as in undertaking a research project of your own." I guess it has opened questions such as, when do we get our dissertation topics? Is it possible to review it now, so going ahead we can always have this at the back of our minds when conducting any research? Do we have to conduct experiments of some sort, gather our own data for discussion duting the dissertation? From my past knowledge I recieved my thesis topics not at the beggining of my studies but after the other modules had been completed so I am curious if it will be the same, or different?
Thanks a million,
Leanne.
