2.5.2: Should I be scared of AI?

Having read Phases One and Two of the ‘Conscious’ background reading, you’ll probably realise by now how the storyline is developing. Now you may well not agree with this particular model of ‘intelligence’ or ‘consciousness’ – that’s fine – but, whatever the real truth is, we can’t deny that AI, in one form or another, is developing all the time. Does this concern you?

In this discussion forum you will first share your thoughts, then reply to two classmates.

Add a thread to this discussion forum and share the following:

(a What do you understand by the term ‘AI’? (See below: what are your ‘axioms’?) Is such a thing possible (by your definition)? What are the benefits or threats of AI? To what extent can we be certain what’s going to happen?. Return to the discussion forum and read the answers of your classmates.

Select two class mates, reply to their posts and for each one:

(b) Comment on how much you agree with their definitions, arguments, claims and conclusions. Remember, in all debate, to treat others’ opinions with respect.  

This is a ‘big’ topic to discuss. And, referring back to the previous discussion (2.5), it may be that what you think or believe depends on where you start from. (In fact, you might want to consider the word ‘axiom’ here: https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/axiom.) So be sure to state any assumptions you’re making in your statements. (Two people with widely different views of what AI actually means will struggle to have a meaningful discussion.) This is a very important ‘life lesson’ and understanding it will be important all the way through your research work (and beyond).
